selenium2-tests
===============

This project is intended to be a reference project for selenium test sweets.  It's based on the principles of the Page Object pattern though it currently does not use the formal Selenium PageObject structure.

The goal is to turn this project into a Maven Archetype to make UX Navigation Flow Tests easy to stand up for any given project.

Suggestion and contributions are welcome and feel free to use this code.  

Currently I could use help with the Chrome Driver as it has issues in the latest implementation.

Usage
=====

From a command prompt type:

mvn clean verify
